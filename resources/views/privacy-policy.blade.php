                    <h2>Manvik Privacy Policy:</h2>
                    <p>Suthar Enterprises built the Manvik app as a free app for hassle-free dealings with references shared by contractors across India. This app is provided by Suthar Enterprises at no cost and is intended for use as a platform to meet contractors and their references.
                    </p>
                    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use our app.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to use our app, then you automatically agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information that we gather is used for providing and improving the app. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as outlined in this privacy policy.</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terminology used in this Privacy Policy has the same meaning as in our Terms and Conditions, which are available at Manvik.</p>

                    <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
                    <p>For a better experience, while using our app, we may need you to provide some personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as outlined in this privacy policy. The app does not use third-party apps that may collect personal information used for their own purposes.</p>
                    <p>We may use third-party apps and services. But, we never share your confidential information with them for any purpose.</p>

                    <h4>Google Play application</h4>
                    <h5>Log Data</h5>
                    <p>We wish to let you know that whenever you use our app, in the event of an issue, we collect data and information on your phone called "Log Data" (through third-party products). This Log Data may include information such as your device's IP address, operating system version, device name, app configuration while using our app, time and date of use, and other statistics.</p>

                    <h5>Cookies</h5>

                    <p>Cookies are small data files that are frequently used as an anonymous unique reference. These are transmitted to your browser from the websites you visit and stored in the internal memory of your device.</p>
                    <p>These "cookies" aren't used openly in this app. Third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve the app may be used in the app. You can choose to accept or reject these cookies, and you'll be notified when one is sent to your device. You might not be able to use some parts of this app if you reject our cookies.</p>

                    <h5>App Providers</h5>
                    <p>For the following reasons, we may employ third parties and individuals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To facilitate our app,</li>
                        <li>To perform something on our behalf,</li>
                        <li>to assist us in analyzing how our app is used.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Users of this app should be aware that these third parties have access to their basic information rather than personal data. The only reason for this is so that they can do the tasks that have been allocated to them on our behalf. They are, however, restricted from sharing or using the information for any other reason.</p>

                    <h5>Security</h5>
                    <p>We value your trust in entrusting us with your personal information, so we strive to protect it in commercially reasonable ways. However, keep in mind that no method of internet transmission or method of electronic storage is entirely secure, and we provide assurance of full trustworthiness but cannot guarantee its full security.</p>

                    <h5>External Links</h5>
                    <p>There may be links to other websites in this app. If required, you will be taken to third-party sites and payment gateways. Please keep in mind that we do not control these third-party applications such as payment gateways. But, we have put a genuine payment gateway to our application for the best convenience.</p>

                    <h5>Modifications to the Privacy Policy</h5>
                    <p>From time to time, we may make necessary changes to our privacy policy. As a result, you should revisit this page periodically to see if anything has changed. Any changes will be communicated to you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
                    <p>This policy is effective as of May 5, 2022.</p>
